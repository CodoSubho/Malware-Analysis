## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:  [Malware Analysis Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ang3loliveira/malware-analysis-datasets-top1000-pe-imports/data). Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use the dataset according to Kaggle's terms and conditions.
## Model

Malware analysis is conducted using the Random Forest algorithm.
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes  of the individual trees.
The model achieved impressive results, with a test accuracy of 97.66% and a precision of 97.78%.
